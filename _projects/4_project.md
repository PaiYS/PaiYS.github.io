Frisson is a feeling and a mental experience of body reactions such as shivers, tingling skin, and goosebumps. However, this sensation is not shareable naturally with others and is rarely used in live performances. We propose Frisson Waves, a real-time system to detect, trigger and share frisson in a wave-like pattern during music performances. The system consists of a physiological sensing wristband for detecting frisson and a thermo-haptic neckband for inducing frisson. We aim to improve the connectedness of audience members and performers during music performances by sharing frisson.
