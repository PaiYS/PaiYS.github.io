Gaze-based interactions promise to be fast, intuitive and effective in controlling virtual and augmented environments. Yet, there is still a lack of usable 3D navigation and observation techniques. In this work: 1) We introduce a highly advantageous orbital navigation technique, AnyOrbit, providing an intuitive and hands-free method of observation in virtual environments that uses eye-tracking to control the orbital center of movement; 2) The versatility of the technique is demonstrated with several control schemes and use-cases in virtual/augmented reality head-mounted-display and desktop setups, including observation of 3D astronomical data and spectator sports.
