To motivate primary school students in Indonesia to learn more, career inspiration sessions are usually held by communities of professionals. However, these activities face limitations such as time, distance and physical infrastructure. We propose IN360, which is an exploration of alternative media to deliver career education to elementary students in remote, undeveloped and frontier area in Indonesia utilizing digital platform and 360-degree-video. The goals of this research are twofold; (1) to create a sustainable system or model for career education content using 360-degree-video format and (2) to deliver it through a digital platform.
