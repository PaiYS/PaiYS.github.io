We present a novel technique of implementing customized hardware that uses eye gaze focus depth as an input modality for virtual reality applications. By utilizing eye tracking technology, our system can detect the point in depth the viewer focusses on, and therefore promises more natural responses of the eye to stimuli, which will help overcoming VR sickness and nausea. The obtained information for the depth focus of the eye allows the utilization of foveated rendering to keep the computing workload low and create a more natural image that is clear in the focused field, but blurred outside that field.
