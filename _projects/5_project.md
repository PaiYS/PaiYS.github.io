We demonstrate WizardOfVR, a personalized emotion-adaptive Virtual Reality (VR) game akin to a Harry Potter experience, which uses using off-the-shelf physiological sensors to create a real-time biofeedback loop between a user’s emotional state and an adaptive VR environment (VRE). In our demo, the user initially trains the system during a calibration process using Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electrodermal Activity (EDA), and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) physiological signals. After calibration, the user will explore a virtual forest with adapting environmental factors based on a ’SanityMeter’ determined by the user’s real-time emotional state. The overall goal is to provide more balanced, immersive, and optimal emotional virtual experiences.
