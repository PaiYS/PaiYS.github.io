VRdoGraphy is a VR photography application where the environment and virtual companion adapt to provide empathic interactions. Using the Galea VR HMD with a range of biosensors, we fed the user's EEG, EDA, EMG, and HRV biosignals into a live emotion prediction system estimating the user's emotions. The VR environment and virtual companion adapt their appearance & tone based on the user's emotions. It shows how VR HMDs with integrated biosensors can provide empathic interactions.
