As virtual reality (VR) usage becomes more popular, one of the issues, among others, which still prevents VR from being used in a more ubiquitous manner is spatial awareness, unlike augmented reality (AR). Generally, there are two forms of such an awareness; recognizing the environment and recognizing other people around us. We propose face2faceVR; an easy to use implementation of AR tracking to assist VR towards recognizing other nearby VR users. The contribution of this work are the following; 1) it is compatible with mobile VR technology that already caters towards a wider adoption, 2) it does not require a networked or shared virtual environment, and 3) it is an inexpensive implementation without any additional peripherals or hardware.
