Chakra, originating in Hinduism, is described as luminous wheels or auras representing different elements within the body that reflect a personâ€™s self-awareness. Chrakra-based meditation techniques can support individual wellbeing, but the provision of Chakra feedback in a visual and tangible manner to facilitate mindfulness is largely unexplored. Transcendental Chakra is a virtual reality (VR) multi-sensory experience using guided audio, visual effects, and vibrotactile feedback to aid beginners in chakra meditation by visualizing their astral avatar. The goal of this work is to foster both spiritual and physical self-awareness.
