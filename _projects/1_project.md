Radar is primarily used for applications like tracking and largescale ranging, and its use for object identification has been rarely explored. This paper introduces RaITIn, a radar-based identification (ID) method for tangible interactions. Unlike conventional radar solutions, RaITIn can track and identify objects on a tabletop scale. We use frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar sensors to classify different objects embedded with low-cost radar reflectors of varying sizes on a tabletop setup. We also introduce Stackable IDs, where different objects can be stacked and combined to produce unique IDs.
