Layout planning is a process often used in architectural interior design, for factory production plans, and so on. We present CleaVR, a system that provides the user with an immersive virtual reality system that accurately visualizes the layout plan in three dimensions. The user is able to freely orbit around the design to observe it in every angle for an accurate evaluation and assessment. The implemented gesture recognition system means that no physical buttons are required, allowing a complete immersion with intuitive controls. These controls allow the user to pan around the environment, pinch to pick and place objects, as well as swiping the view to switch into first person view. With our system, architects, engineers, designers, and even sports analysts may approach their targeted environment
