NatureBlendVR is a hybrid interactive experience designed to promote wellbeing by leveraging the benefits of forest bathing. The system combines XR technology with interactive bio-responsive physical elements. Throughout the experience, users are immersed in a hybrid space where elements of a physical garden are placed in the immediate surroundings of the user, including a flower sphere that provides haptic and visual biofeedback reacting to the personâ€™s heartbeat. A gradual transition from the view of the real space to a meticulously crafted virtual forest where digital elements match the position of physical ones promotes a sense of continuity, allowing the person to feel present in the natural space as embodied sensations match the expectation created by virtual interactions.
