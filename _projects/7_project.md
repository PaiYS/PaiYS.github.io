The recent emergence of point cloud streaming technologies has spawned new ways to digitally perceive and manipulate live data of users and spaces. The graphical rendering limitations prevent state-of-the-art interaction techniques from achieving segmented bare-body user input to manipulate live point cloud data. We propose BridgedReality, a toolkit that enables users to produce localized virtual effects in live scenes, without the need for an HMD nor any wearable devices or virtual controllers. Our method uses body tracking and an illusory rendering technique to achieve large scale, depth-based, real time interaction with multiple light field projection display interfaces. This toolkit circumvented time-consuming 3D object classification, and packaged multiple proximity effects in a format understandable by middle schoolers.
