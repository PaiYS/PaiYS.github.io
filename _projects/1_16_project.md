Autobiographical memory recall can be triggered through sensory stimuli, often creating a positive impact on emotional well-being. However, there are few systems that can adapt to users’ emotional state and provide personalized stimuli to better support this process. Re-Touch enhances memory recall through the integration of Virtual Reality (VR), haptic feedback, and affective computing. It allows users to revisit their personal memories in a controlled VR space. By monitoring physiological responses (photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrodermal activity (EDA)) the system adjusts the haptic feedback intensity and the VR content to match the user’s emotional needs, enhancing sensory and emotional immersion.
