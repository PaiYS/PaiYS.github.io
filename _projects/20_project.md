With the increasing popularity of virtual reality (VR) technologies, more eforts have been going into developing new input methods. While physical controllers are widely used, more novel techniques, such as eye tracking, are now commercially available. In our work, we investigate the use of physiological signals as input to enhance VR experiences. We present a system using gaze tracking and electromyography on a user’s forearm to make selection tasks in virtual spaces more efcient. In a study with 16 participants, we compared fve diferent input techniques using a Fitts’ law task: Using gaze tracking for cursor movement in combination with forearm contractions for making selections was superior to using an HTC Vive controller, Xbox gamepad, dwelling time, and eye-gaze dwelling time. To explore application scenarios and collect qualitative feedback, we further developed and evaluated a game with our input technique. Our fndings inform the design of applications that use eye-gaze tracking and forearm muscle movements for efective user input in VR.
