Micro-motions are often difficult to incorporate in VR while macro-motions are a popular interaction method, due to technological limitations with VR tracking methods. In this poster, we introduce VRTwitch, a forearm-mounted wearable device that is able to sense micro hand motions. VRTwitch uses an array of reconfigurable miniaturized radar sensors placed around the hand to capture subtle finger movements for gesture detection towards enhanced interaction in VR space. We created a simple interactive VR shooting game that requires precise finger motion for virtual gun manipulation as a demonstration.
