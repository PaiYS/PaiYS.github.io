Nonverbal cues, especially eye gaze, plays an important role in our daily communication, not just as an indicator of interest, but also as a method to convey information to another party. In this work, we propose a simulation of human eye gaze in Virtual Reality content to improve immersion of interaction between user and virtual agent. We developed an eye-tracking integrated interactive narrative content with a focus on player’s interaction with gaze aware virtual agent, which is capable of reacting towards the player’s gaze to simulate real human-to-human communication in VR environment and conducted an initial study to measure user’s reaction.
