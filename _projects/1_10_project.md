we propose the development of Virtual Journalist, a virtual reality (VR) system that immerses users in the role of a journalist, allowing them to consume 360 degree video documentaries and capture moments that evoke cultural empathy through photography. Furthermore, this system integrates both cognitive and affective dimensions of empathy by linking physiological data, namely electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate variability (HRV), to the captured photographs. Our findings suggest that the impact of Virtual Journalist varies based on the user's cultural background, and we have observed that empathic accuracy can be achieved by combining user-generated photographs with corresponding physiological data.
