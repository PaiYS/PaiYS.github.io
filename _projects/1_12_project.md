Anxiety and stress have gradually become commonplace mental health problems afflicting many people worldwide. We propose asmVR, a novel approach to enhance the autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) experience by combining multimodal triggers including visual, auditory, tactile, and emotional stimuli. asmVR helps users enhance ASMR tingling sensations through online and offline modes, provides realistic VR environments and remote avatar ASMRtist for users, showcasing its potential for stress relief, emotion regulation, and customization. Additionally, it reveals new possibilities for the future application of VR in the field of psychotherapy.
