In Project Corvus, we explore the ways in which virtual reality (VR) and psychological programs such as exposure therapy can be combined to inform the psycho-educational opportunities in this horror-themed direction. More specifically, to leverage peopleâ€™s morbid curiosity towards horror for the development of self-efficacy. Through short repetition of horror virtual experiences, the goal is to design an assistive program that can help the participants develop their skills in controlling their emotions even when facing real crises in the future.
