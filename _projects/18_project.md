We present ShareHaptics, a novel modular system to provide tactile and pressure feedback in mixed reality applications using a novel actuator: shape memory alloy (SMA). We apply it to fingers, wrist and foot ankle. Although it can be used for haptic feedback in a diverse set of use cases, we specifically focus on collaborative applications: ShareHaptics allows to haptically jack-in to a remote environment via a custom glove and ankle braces. We demonstrate a wide range of applications: watching sports, gaming, and collaborative discussions and skill transfer.
