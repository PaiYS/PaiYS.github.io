My interview by Eval Wolfangel regarding the future of spatial computing is now out in the German version of MIT technology review! The article is available online <a href="https://www.heise.de/select/tr/2023/7/2320908254643308437">here</a>, yet it requires paid subscription. Luckily, since you're here, <a href="ttps://yunsuenpai.com/assets/pdf/german_MIT_technology_interview.pdf">this</a> links to the PDF file directly ;)
