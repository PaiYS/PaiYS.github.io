My vision of the future is that of an Inclusive Reality. It is a future where the sense of reality can be leveraged to bridge social and ability gaps towards an inclusive prosocial space. To achieve this, I explore systems that 
- understand cognitive, behavioral and emotional states, 
- assist the self and others, and 
- augment abilities to empower diverse individuals.

I graduated from the University of Malaya, Malaysia (UM) in 2013 with a degree in Computer-Aided Design and Manufacturing Engineering. I then furthered my research at UM which focuses on the use of AR technology for simulating machining processes, to obtain my Masters in Engineering Science in 2015. In 2018, I earned my Ph.D in Media Design from the Keio University Graduate School of Media Design (KMD) with my thesis entitled "Convex Interactions: Towards Efficient Human Motion in Peripersonal Space Using Virtual Reality". For my postdoctoral research, I travelled to New Zealand to join the <a href='http://empathiccomputing.org/'>Empathic Computing Laboratory</a> (ECL) for 2 years. Afterwards, I was a Project Senior Assistant Professor (non-tenured) at KMD, directing the <a href='https://www.embodiedmedia.org/teams/physionetic-interactions'>Physionetic Interactions Group</a> in the <a href='https://www.embodiedmedia.org/about'>Embodied Media Laboratory</a> until 2023. I am currently a <a href='https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/yun-suen-pai/about'>Lecturer</a> (tenured) in the University of Auckland, New Zealand where I co-direct ECL with Prof Mark Billinghurst. 

Besides research, I also love travelling, gaming, airsoft, customizing keyboards, collecting watches, and messing with my corgi, <a href='https://www.instagram.com/hci.with.bambi/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y%3D'>Bambi</a>. Hit me up anytime if you are into any of these things!
