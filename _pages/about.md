I am currently a Project Senior Assistant Professor at the Keio University Graduate School of Media Design, directing the Physionetic Interactions Group in the Embodied Media Laboratory. My research interest is in augmented/virtual/mixed reality, human-computer interaction, physiological sensing, and human factors. I graduated from the University of Malaya, Malaysia (UM) in 2013 with a degree in Computer-Aided Design and Manufacturing Engineering. I then furthered my research at UM which focuses on the use of AR technology for simulating machining processes, to obtain my Masters in Engineering Science in 2015. In 2018, I earned my Ph.D in Media Design from the Keio University Graduate School of Media Design with my thesis entitled "Convex Interactions: Towards Efficient Human Motion in Peripersonal Space Using Virtual Reality". For my postdoctoral research, I travelled to the beautiful land of New Zealand to join the Empathic Computing Laboratory under Prof Mark Billinghurst.

Besides research, I also love travelling, gaming, airsoft, customizing keyboards, and collecting watches. Hit me up anytime if you are into any of these things!
