I am a researcher at the Keio University Graduate School of Media Design. Currently, my research interest is on everything virtual reality, augmented reality, artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction. I graduated from the University of Malaya, Malaysia (UM) on 2013 with a degree in Computer-Aided Design and Manufacturing Engineering. I then furthered my research at UM which focuses on the use of AR technology for simulating machining processes, to obtain my Masters in Engineering Science on 2015. On 2018, I earned my Ph.D in Media Design from the Keio University Graduate School of Media Design with my thesis entitled "Convex Interactions: Towards Efficient Human Motion in Peripersonal Space Using Virtual Reality".

Besides research, I also love travelling, gaming and badminton. Hit me up anytime if you are into any of these things!

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
